## Motivation

When we create policies to standardize things like the structure of our company's Git repositories, the dynamic creation of Kubernets environments, the generation of configuration files for routers, ... we find the problem of integrate them into our CI / CD flows.

With Standardized Objects, our policies are defined as code and users have a simple way to create objects standardized by the company and integrate them into their CI / CD flows.
